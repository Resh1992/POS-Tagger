## POS Tagger

We intend to implement bigram HMM POS tagger and calculate the Viterbi Matrix for the sentence: "learning changes throughly" using the following emission probabilities:

P(learning|V) = 0.003

P(changes|V) = 0.004

P(throughly|Adv) = 0.002

P(learning|N) = 0.001

P(changes|N) = 0.003

## To run
python viterbi.py
